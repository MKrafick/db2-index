This project aims to provide a content index about all DB2 for LUW terms.
This is not a documentation repository; instead, it is like the index of a book,
and the Internet is the book.
This repository contains a lot of web references (URLs) to different sites
that explains a particular concept in DB2.

The index itself is in the Wiki of this project.
Anyone can modify the wiki, and it is just necessary to have a GitHub and be
signed in.

The indes (the links) are not in the "code" part, because that needs a push
and sometimes a pull request and then a merge.
Instead, editing directly in the wiki allows to anyone modify the content
and a better interesaction.

You are welcome to reference your entries, they could entries written / recorded
by yourself, or from by a trusted / well-know person.

I want to thanks to the following persons, because they keep creating content
about DB2:

* Ember Crooks - DB2Commence. http://db2commerce.com/
* Harishkumar Pathanga - DB2-LUW-Academy. https://www.youtube.com/user/DB2LUWAcademy/videos
